# MathsWithGolang

**MathsWithGolang** is a comprehensive Go library designed to implement algorithms across a wide range of mathematical domains. This project is structured for educational purposes and practical computation, covering everything from basic arithmetic in various number systems to advanced calculus and algebraic structures.

## 📚 Project Structure

The project is organized into 9 main modules, each containing 8 chapters of detailed implementations:

*   **[01_Calculus](./01_Calculus)**: Fundamentals of calculus, limits, continuity, differentiation, integration, series, and multivariable calculus.
*   **[02_LinearAlgebra](./02_LinearAlgebra)**: Vectors, matrices, determinants, linear systems, eigenvalues, transformations, and decompositions.
*   **[03_Limits](./03_Limits)**: In-depth exploration of sequence and function limits, including L'Hôpital's rule and continuity.
*   **[04_Derivatives](./04_Derivatives)**: Differentiation rules, higher-order derivatives, implicit/partial differentiation, and optimization.
*   **[05_Functions](./05_Functions)**: Implementation of exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, hyperbolic, and special functions.
*   **[06_NumericalSequences](./06_NumericalSequences)**: Arithmetic, geometric, and recursive sequences, convergence tests, and series.
*   **[07_AlgebraicStructures](./07_AlgebraicStructures)**: Abstract algebra concepts including groups, rings, fields, and polynomials.
*   **[08_Arithmetic](./08_Arithmetic)**: Arithmetic operations in various number systems: ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, 𝔻, ℝ, ℂ, ℍ.
*   **[09_ComplexNumbers](./09_ComplexNumbers)**: Comprehensive complex number operations, polar forms, and applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Go 1.18 or higher

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mouaadid/MathsWithGolang.git
cd MathsWithGolang
```

### Usage

To run the main demonstration program:

```bash
go run main.go
```

To run tests for a specific module (e.g., Calculus):

```bash
go test ./01_Calculus/...
```

## 📖 Documentation

Each module directory contains its own `README.md` with specific details about the chapters and algorithms implemented therein. Code is heavily commented to explain the mathematical concepts behind the algorithms.
